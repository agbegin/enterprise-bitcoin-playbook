# Enterprise Bitcoin Playbook
A collection of resources & ideas that answer the question "When, why and how will enterprises adopt Bitcoin?" 

## Overview
Institutional adoption of Digital Assets is here. Executives and consultants are looking for ways to drive business value from the long list of crypto-related technology: cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, blockchain, web3, tokenization, and of course Bitcoin. 

In the world of Digital Assets, Bitcoin stands alone. And there is no second best. As Enterprises recognize the world-changing and foundational impact of Bitcoin, the question shifts from "if" they should have a Bitcoin strategy to "when and how." The "why" is clear: either disrupt or be disrupted. 

Enterprise Bitcoin Playbook (EBP) is a platform for exploring these questions and fostering discussion between professionals seeking to answer them. 

## Audience 
EBP convenes discussions at the meeting point of three perspectives: corporate leaders, enterprise consultants, and bitcoin builders. 
* The corporate leader: Involved in making financial and technology decisions for an organization. Looking to disrupt competition and prevent being disrupted.
* The enterprise consultant: Seeking technologies that have staying power to avoid hitching the client’s wagon to a passing fad.
* The Bitcoin builder: Building a better financial system on top of Bitcoin. Pushing to make global adoption happen without the distractions of CBDCs, NFTs or endless blockchains.

## Goal 
Help enterprise leaders assess and adapt to the digital transformation of money that’s currently underway.
